The TripSit.Me bot is a relatively simple bot that provides access to the TripSit API.

The goals with this bot are:
1) Make TripSit a fun and safe place to be!
2) Spread access to TripSit's information by allowing greater access to our wiki.
3) Get traffic back to us, ultimately to gather more information that can be spread further and help more people!

The methods in which we will do this:
1) Be useful enough that people want this bot on their servers
2) Be lightweight (not require a lot of permissions) enough to be invited to servers without people worrying about security
3) By putting this bot on certain websites we will introduce ourselves to people who have not heard of us yet when they search for a "drug" "dose" bot
4) By having "TripSit.Me" in the name people will immediately know 1) our org name and 2) our website, and it doesnt look like that bad of a bot name either?

Planned MVP Feature Priority:

Planned Extra Feature Priority:
/report USER - Much like the IRC, sends a message to the moderation room
/remindme - Set reminders for yourself in the future
/qadd Quote

Fix Priority:
Nothing right now!

Denied Features:
Rainbow Role  - Changing the role color every few seconds: Discord would want to murder me for abusing the API.
Karma++ - This would require the Messages privilege, and discord doesn't give out this permission lightly. Instead, the idea is to react with an emoji to show your support! We can try to use the :ts_up: as good karma and the :reddit_downvote:  as bad
